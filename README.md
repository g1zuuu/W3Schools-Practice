<html> → The root element of an HTML document. It contains all the content.

<title> → Sets the title of the web page, displayed in the browser tab.
<body> → Contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links.
  
2. Text Elements
<h1> to <h6> → Heading tags, with <h1> being the largest and <h6> the smallest. Used to structure content hierarchically.
<p> → Defines a paragraph. It automatically creates space before and after the text.
<br> → Inserts a line break. Unlike <p>, it does not add spacing.
<hr> → Creates a horizontal line, often used to separate sections.

3. Text Formatting
<b> → Makes text bold but does not add extra importance.
<strong> → Makes text bold and indicates strong importance.
<i> → Displays text in italics for styling purposes.
<em> → Displays text in italics with emphasis (used for semantic meaning).
